    Louisiana elections use the majority-vote system. All candidates compete in the same primary, 
    and a candidate can win the election outright by receiving more than 50 percent of the vote. 
    This means, for all intents and purposes, you should <b>absolutely</b> vote your heart on Nov 8 for this race.
    You don't need to vote for whoever seems most likely to win.

    There will be a run-off race on December 10, and that is when you will need to vote the proverbial "lesser of two evils."
